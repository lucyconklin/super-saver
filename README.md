## Cool Tools

### React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). It is a really cool framework that is being used a lot these days, especially for single page apps. I particularly like how the components are broken down. It feels very object oriented to me, and helps wrangle the css into manageable chunks.

### SASS

I am a huge fan of [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/). It is a super powerful preprocessor that gives you access to variables in CSS, and has two simplified syntaxes that make writing CSS much easier. You can also use mixins, inheritance, and operators for added functionality. I mostly used the variable feature in my src/shared.css file to easily modify colors and fonts throughout the project.

### Bootstrap

Developed by twitter as a super useful 12 column grid system, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is a css framework and is my go-to tool for styling a site quickly. It has lots of ready to go features like a navbar, button styles, or full width image that can be implemented quickly. The downside is that customization can be tricky, and I don't particularly love some of the default styles.
